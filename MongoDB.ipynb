    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular open-source document-oriented NoSQL database that provides high scalability, flexibility, and performance. It stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON), allowing for dynamic and schema-less data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are designed to handle unstructured, semi-structured, and rapidly changing data. Unlike traditional SQL databases, which use a tabular structure and predefined schemas, NoSQL databases provide flexibility in data modeling and can handle large amounts of data with high scalability and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in the following scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible and evolving data models: MongoDB's schema-less nature allows for easy handling of evolving data structures and schema changes. It is suitable for use cases where data models are not well-defined or may change frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability and high-performance: MongoDB's distributed architecture allows for horizontal scaling across multiple servers, enabling it to handle large datasets and high write and read throughput efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-based data storage: MongoDB's document-oriented approach makes it suitable for storing and retrieving complex and hierarchical data structures, such as JSON-like documents, nested arrays, and embedded objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-time analytics and Big Data: MongoDB's aggregation framework and indexing capabilities provide powerful tools for performing real-time analytics on large datasets. It is often used in Big Data applications where real-time data analysis and fast data access are critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rapid application development: MongoDB's flexible data model and rich query capabilities make it well-suited for agile development processes, allowing developers to quickly iterate and adapt their data models as application requirements evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the key features of MongoDB are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-oriented: MongoDB stores data in flexible and self-descriptive JSON-like documents called BSON. This allows for easy handling of complex data structures and dynamic schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalable and High-performance: MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through sharding, allowing it to handle large datasets and high traffic loads. It also provides efficient indexing, query optimization, and automatic load balancing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible Data Model: MongoDB's schema-less nature allows for dynamic and evolving data models. It supports rich queries, ad-hoc joins, and multi-document transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replication and High Availability: MongoDB supports replica sets, which provide automatic failover and data redundancy for high availability. Replica sets ensure that data remains accessible even in the event of server failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed File Storage: MongoDB GridFS allows for storing and retrieving large files, such as images, videos, and documents, using a distributed file storage system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation Framework: MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework for performing advanced data analysis, grouping, filtering, and transformation operations on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geospatial Indexing: MongoDB has built-in support for geospatial data and provides geospatial indexing and query capabilities for location-based applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rich Query Language: MongoDB's query language (MongoDB Query Language or MQL) supports a wide range of query operations, including advanced filtering, sorting, aggregation, and text search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Write a code to connect MongoDB to Python. Also, create a database and a collection in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect MongoDB to Python and create a database and a collection, you can use the pymongo library. Here's an example code:\n",
