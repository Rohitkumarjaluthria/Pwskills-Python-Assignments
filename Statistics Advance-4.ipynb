    "Q1: What is the difference between a t-test and a z-test? Provide an example scenario where you would\n",
    "use each type of test.\n",
    "\n",
    " The main difference between a t-test and a z-test lies in the information available about the population variance. A t-test is used when the population variance is unknown or estimated from the sample, whereas a z-test is used when the population variance is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you want to compare the mean heights of two groups of students (Group A and Group B). If you have the population variance of heights, you can use a z-test to compare the means. However, if you only have the sample variances of heights from each group, you would need to use a t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: Differentiate between one-tailed and two-tailed tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-tailed and two-tailed tests refer to the directionality of the statistical hypothesis being tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a one-tailed test, the hypothesis is specified to test for a difference or relationship in only one direction. For example, you may want to test if a new drug improves test scores and hypothesize that the drug will increase test scores. In this case, you would use a one-tailed test and look for evidence to support the hypothesis that the drug increases test scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a two-tailed test, the hypothesis is not specific to a particular direction and tests for a difference or relationship in both directions. For example, you may want to test if there is a difference in test scores between two groups without specifying whether one group is expected to have higher scores. In this case, you would use a two-tailed test and look for evidence of a difference in either direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: Explain the concept of Type 1 and Type 2 errors in hypothesis testing. Provide an example scenario for\n",
    "each type of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type 1 error refers to rejecting a null hypothesis when it is actually true. It is the incorrect rejection of a true statement. An example scenario would be conducting a drug effectiveness study and concluding that the drug is effective when it actually has no effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type 2 error refers to failing to reject a null hypothesis when it is actually false. It is the failure to reject a false statement. An example scenario would be conducting a drug effectiveness study and failing to conclude that the drug is effective when it actually has an effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: Explain Bayes's theorem with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes's theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that describes how to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. It involves combining prior knowledge or beliefs (prior probability) with observed data (likelihood) to calculate the updated probability (posterior probability) of the hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you want to know the probability of having a certain disease given a positive test result. Bayes's theorem allows you to combine the prevalence of the disease in the population (prior probability) with the accuracy of the test (likelihood) to calculate the updated probability of having the disease (posterior probability).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: What is a confidence interval? How to calculate the confidence interval, explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence. It provides an estimate of the precision or uncertainty associated with a sample statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate a confidence interval, you need the sample statistic (e.g., mean or proportion), the sample size, the variability of the data, and the desired level of confidence. For example, if you want to estimate the mean height of a population with a 95% confidence interval, you would calculate the mean and standard deviation from your sample and use a formula to determine the range of values within which the true population mean is likely to fall with 95% confidence."

    "Let's assume we want to calculate the probability of a patient having a certain disease given the results of a diagnostic test.\n",

    "Prior Information:\n",
    "\n",
    "The prevalence of the disease in the population is 10% (prior probability).\n",

    "A patient tests positive for the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the updated probability (posterior probability) of the patient having the disease given the positive test result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(D) = Probability of having the disease (prior probability) = 0.10\n",
    "\n",
    "P(D') = Probability of not having the disease = 1 - P(D) = 0.90\n",
    "\n",
    "P(T|D) = Probability of a positive test result given the disease (sensitivity) = 0.90\n",
    "\n",
    "P(T|D') = Probability of a positive test result given no disease (1 - specificity) = 0.05\n",

    "P(D|T) = (P(T|D) * P(D)) / [P(T|D) * P(D) + P(T|D') * P(D')]\n",

    "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for a sample of data with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 5, we need to consider the sample size and the desired level of confidence.\n",

    "Using the formula for a confidence interval for a mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence Interval = Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n",
    "\n",

    "Provide an example of a scenario where a larger sample size would result in a smaller margin of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin of error in a confidence interval represents the maximum amount by which a point estimate (e.g., mean) is expected to differ from the true population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin of error is influenced by the sample size. A larger sample size leads to a smaller margin of error because it reduces the variability and increases the precision of the estimate.\n",
