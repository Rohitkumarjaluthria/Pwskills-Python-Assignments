    "\n",
    "Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, are used to describe the spread or variability of a dataset. They provide information about how the data points are distributed around the central tendency measures (mean, median, etc.).\n",
    "Range:\n",
    "The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and represents the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It provides a rough estimate of the spread but does not consider the distribution of values within that range. For example, if we have a dataset of test scores ranging from 60 to 90, the range would be 90 - 60 = 30, indicating a spread of 30 points between the highest and lowest scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance:\n",
    "Variance is a measure of dispersion that quantifies the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. It considers the differences between each value and the mean, and then calculates the average of the squared differences. A higher variance indicates a greater spread of data points. For example, if we have a dataset of exam scores with a small variance, it suggests that the scores are closely clustered around the mean, while a large variance indicates more variability or spread in the scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation:\n",
    "The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and is another widely used measure of dispersion. It provides a measure of the average distance between each data point and the mean. Like variance, a higher standard deviation indicates greater spread or variability in the dataset. Standard deviation is often preferred because it is in the same unit as the original data and provides a more interpretable measure of spread. For example, if we have a dataset of employee salaries with a small standard deviation, it suggests that the salaries are relatively close to the mean, while a large standard deviation indicates greater variability or spread in the salaries."
