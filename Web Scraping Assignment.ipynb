    "Q1. What is Web Scraping? Why is it Used? Give three areas where Web Scraping is used to get data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping refers to the process of extracting data from websites by parsing and analyzing the HTML or XML code. It involves automated crawling and scraping of web pages to collect specific information for various purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is used for several reasons, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Extraction: Web scraping allows you to extract data from websites that do not offer an API or provide limited access to their data. It enables you to gather structured data from different sources and use it for analysis, research, or other applications.\n",
    "Competitive Intelligence: Web scraping is commonly employed to gather information about competitors, such as pricing data, product details, or customer reviews. This data can be used to gain insights, monitor market trends, and make informed business decisions.\n",
    "Research and Monitoring: Web scraping is utilized in various fields for research purposes, such as gathering data for academic studies, monitoring social media sentiment, tracking news articles, or collecting data for market research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various methods used for web scraping, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Manual Scraping: This involves manually copying and pasting data from web pages into a spreadsheet or text file. It is suitable for small-scale data extraction tasks but can be time-consuming and inefficient for large-scale scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular Expressions (Regex): Regular expressions are used to match and extract specific patterns or data from HTML or text documents. Regex can be effective for simple scraping tasks but may become complex and difficult to maintain for more extensive scraping requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML/XML Parsers: These are libraries or modules that parse and analyze the HTML or XML code of web pages to extract relevant data. Examples include Beautiful Soup, lxml, and html.parser. Parsers offer a more structured and efficient way to extract data from web pages by navigating the HTML/XML tree structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web Scraping Frameworks: Frameworks such as Scrapy provide a comprehensive toolset for web scraping. They offer features like automated crawling, data extraction, handling of JavaScript, and data processing pipelines. These frameworks simplify the web scraping process and allow for scalable and efficient scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is Beautiful Soup? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Beautiful Soup is a popular Python library used for web scraping and parsing HTML or XML documents. It provides a simple and intuitive API for extracting data from web pages by traversing the HTML/XML tree structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beautiful Soup is used for web scraping because of its key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML/XML Parsing: Beautiful Soup can parse and navigate through HTML or XML documents, allowing easy access to specific elements or data within the document.\n",
    "Data Extraction: It provides methods to extract data based on various filters like tag names, CSS selectors, attribute values, etc. This makes it easy to locate and extract specific information from web pages.\n",
    "Tree Traversal: Beautiful Soup allows you to navigate the HTML/XML tree structure using methods like find(), find_all(), parent, children, siblings, etc. This enables efficient and precise data extraction by traversing the document's hierarchy.\n",
    "Robustness: Beautiful Soup is designed to handle imperfect or poorly formatted HTML/XML documents, making it resilient to errors or inconsistencies in the markup.\n",
    "Integration: It integrates well with other Python libraries and frameworks commonly used in web scraping projects, such as requests for making HTTP requests and pandas for data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Why is Flask used in this Web Scraping project?\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is a lightweight web framework in Python used for developing web applications and APIs. In the context of a web scraping project, Flask can be used to create a web server to host a web page or API endpoint for accessing the scraped data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is often utilized in web scraping projects for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Presentation: Flask allows you to create dynamic web pages or API endpoints to present the scraped data in a user-friendly manner. It enables you to design custom routes and templates to display the data or serve it through API responses.\n",
    "API Development: Flask provides an easy and efficient way to develop RESTful APIs to expose the scraped data. This allows other applications or users to access the data programmatically and integrate it into their own projects.\n",
    "Interactivity: Flask enables you to add interactivity to your web scraping project by incorporating forms, user authentication, and other interactive components. This can be useful for handling user input, customization options, or data filtering."

    "\n",
    "EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): EC2 is used to provision virtual servers in the cloud. In a web scraping project, EC2 can be utilized to deploy and run the web scraping script or application.\n",
