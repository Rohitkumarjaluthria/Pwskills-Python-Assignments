    "Python programming language was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Guido van Rossum is a Dutch programmer, and he is often referred to as the \"Benevolent Dictator For Life\" (BDFL) of the Python community. He designed and implemented Python with the goal of creating a language that emphasizes simplicity, readability, and code maintainability. Guido van Rossum released the first version of Python (Python 0.9.0) in 1991, and he continued to lead the development of Python until he stepped down as the BDFL in 2018."
