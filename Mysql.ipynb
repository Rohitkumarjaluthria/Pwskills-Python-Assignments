    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized, stored, and managed to serve various applications efficiently. It provides a way to store and retrieve data reliably and securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that use a tabular structure to organize and store data. They follow a predefined schema and use SQL for querying and manipulating data. SQL databases are known for their strong consistency, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, and support for complex transactions. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that do not rely on a fixed schema. They provide flexibility in handling unstructured or semi-structured data and are designed to scale horizontally. NoSQL databases use various data models such as key-value, document, columnar, or graph. They offer high scalability, performance, and flexibility but may sacrifice some level of consistency. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Primary Key: A primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It ensures the uniqueness and integrity of the data within a table. A primary key constraint enforces the primary key property. For example, in a \"users\" table, an \"id\" column can be defined as the primary key to uniquely identify each user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables by enforcing referential integrity. It ensures that the values in the foreign key column(s) match with the values in the primary key column(s) of the referenced table. For example, in a \"orders\" table, a \"user_id\" column can be defined as a foreign key that references the \"id\" column in the \"users\" table. This establishes a relationship between orders and users, ensuring that only valid user IDs can be inserted in the \"user_id\" column.\n",
